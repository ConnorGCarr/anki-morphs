# Installation

You can download the latest version of AnkiMorphs from [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/472573498). You can
find
previous versions [on github releases](https://github.com/mortii/anki-morphs/releases).

AnkiMorphs parses text into morphs by using external morphemizers, and different languages will require different
morphemizers.

For Japanese you use a [MeCab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeCab) morphemizer by downloading this companion add-on:
- [ankimorphs-japanese-mecab](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1974309724) (installation code: `1974309724`)   
  Once this add-on has been installed and Anki has been restarted, the morphemizer will show up as the option `AnkiMorphs: Japanese`

For other languages you can install [install spaCy](installation/installing-spacy.md), which currently supports:

Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (Modern), Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Lithuanian, Macedonian, Norwegian (Bokm√•l), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish,
Ukrainian.



After the installation is complete, some [Setup](setup.md) is required to get AnkiMorphs to work. After that you can
run [Recalc](usage/recalc.md) and you will be good to go!

[Here is an overview](installation/changes-to-anki.md) of the changes that are made to Anki after installing AnkiMorphs.
