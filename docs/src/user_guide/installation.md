# Installation

You can download the latest version of AnkiMorphs from [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/472573498). You can find
previous versions [here](https://github.com/mortii/anki-morphs/releases).

AnkiMorphs comes with a built-in Japanese morphemizer, but if you want to use other languages, then you have to install spaCy. 


After the installation is complete, some [Setup](setup.md) is required to get AnkiMorphs to work. After that you can
run [Recalc](usage/recalc.md) and you will be good to go!

[Here is an overview](installation/changes-to-anki.md) of the changes that are made to Anki after installing AnkiMorphs.
