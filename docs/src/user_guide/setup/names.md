# Names

You can have AnkiMorphs automatically filter out specified names found on your cards. This feature is designed so users
won't have to learn the names of places or individuals, as these words lack
inherent meaning that can be acquired.

To activate this feature, navigate to ``Tool > AnkiMorphs > Settings > Skip > Parse`` and tick the option ``Ignore names
found in "names.txt"``

The `names.txt` file is located in your [anki profile folder](../glossary.md#profile-folder).

You can either update this file manually, or during a review you can also add names to the list by selecting a word,
right-clicking it, and choosing "Mark as name" from the dropdown menu.
