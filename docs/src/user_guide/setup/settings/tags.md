# Tags


![tags-tab.png](../../../img/tags-tab.png)

As part of the process of sorting cards based on their difficult, AnkiMorphs automatically adds and removes tags to the
cards you specified in the “Note Filter” tab.

You can customize the names of the different tags if you want, or you can just leave them as they are and move on.
