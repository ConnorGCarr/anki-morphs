# Skip

This is where you can make AnkiMorphs really efficient. AnkiMorphs sorts
your cards based on how well you know its content; the more you know, the sooner the card will be shown. The downside is
this is that it might take a long time before you see a cards with any unknown morphs, i.e., you don't learn anything
new.

To overcome this problem and speed up the learning process we can use the options found here.

* **Skip cards with only known morphs**:  
  If AnkiMorph has determined that you know all the morphs on the card, then it will be buried and skipped.
* **Skip cards that have unknown morphs already seen today**:  
  If you have already studied a card earlier today with the same unknown morph, then any subsequent cards with that
  unknown morph will be buried and skipped. This option is beneficial because it means you don't have
  to [Recalc](../../usage/recalc.md) as often.
* **Show "skipped x cards" notification**:  
  After cards are skipped, a notification in the lower left corner displays how many cards were skipped and for what
  reason. If you don't want to see this notification, you can uncheck this option.
