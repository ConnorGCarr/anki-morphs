# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you add make AnkiMorphs work on Anki qt5?

No, supporting multiple versions of Qt is too detrimental to the project's workflow and code-base.

[The last release of Qt 5 was in May 2023](https://www.qt.io/blog/the-conversion-program-is-ending), so using Qt 6 is
the sensible thing to do.
