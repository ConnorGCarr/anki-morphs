### Can you add make AnkiMorphs work on Anki qt5?

Supporting multiple versions of Qt creates too much complexity in the code and the workflow of the project to be worth it.

[The last release of Qt 5 was in May 2023](https://www.qt.io/blog/the-conversion-program-is-ending), so using Qt 6 is
the sensible thing to do.
