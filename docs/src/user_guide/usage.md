* [Reviewing cards](usage/reviewing-cards.md) with AnkiMorphs.
* Using the [Browser Options](usage/browser.md).
* [Generate frequency files](usage/generators/frequency-file-generator.md) to change morph priorities.
* [Generate readability reports](usage/generators/readability-report-generator.md) to find out much of specified files you will be able to read.
* [Export known morphs](usage/known-morphs-exporter.md) so you can trim down your card collection.
