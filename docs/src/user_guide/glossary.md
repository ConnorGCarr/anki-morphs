### 1T Sentence

Abbreviation for “one-target sentence”. A sentence that contains one unknown word or grammar structure. The unknown word
or structure is referred to as the “target word” or “target structure”.

Learning through 1T sentences can be thought of as “picking low-hanging fruit”. It makes the target word/structure easy
to understand and retain. As you continue to learn, sentences that were previously one-target will become zero-target,
and sentences that were previously multi-target will become one-target. In this way, one-target sentences can take you
all the way to fluency.

### MT Sentence
Abbreviation for “multi-target sentence”. A sentence that contains **more than** one unknown word or grammar structure.

### Morph

Short for the word "morpheme." A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit of speech; it may be a word, like
"place" or "an," or an element of a word, like re- and -ed in "reappeared."[^britannica]

### sub2srs

You can get automatically generated Anki cards from tv-shows or movies by using a tool called sub2srs. Generating decks
with sub2srs is pretty technical so I recommend finding sub2srs decks other people
have already made.

[You can download many different anime sub2srs decks from this site.](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/p17g5uk4phb41/User_Uploaded_Anki_Decks)

### Databases

AnkiMorphs creates a local sqlite database called 'ankimorphs.db' stored in your Anki profile folder.

You can find the folder here:

* Windows: `C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\[profile_name]\dbs.`
* Mac: `/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/Anki2/[profile_name]/dbs`
